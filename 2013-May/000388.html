<PRE>The following problem reports have not yet been marked as `taken up' by a
message to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-bugs">done at bugs.x2go.org</A> or or `forwarded' by a
message to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-bugs">forwarded at bugs.x2go.org.</A>
The maintainer listed against each package is derived from the Maintainer
field of the package found in the development tree; there is an override file
that can be amended to get the right results if you have taken over a package
and do not expect to issue a new version soon.

Variant versions of the Maintainer field for the same actual package
maintainer will be listed separately.

Maintainers with few outstanding Bugs appear first, to avoid those with few
Bugs being lost deep in the message.
